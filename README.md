(TO BE UPDATED)

This repo provides some tools for monitoring the CoW AMM launched on mainnet by the CoW DAO in this address `0xBEEf5aFE88eF73337e5070aB2855d37dBF5493A4`

Before using it, one needs to create an `.env` file and add an `"Name of the Scan"_KEY` (ex : 'ETHERSCAN_KEY', 'GNOSISSCAN_KEY') variable that contains (as a string) an API key obtained from Etherscan (see [here](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/viewing-api-usage-statistics) for details on how to obtain one). 

Then, upadate all the parameters in the constants.py file for the AMM Vault you are studying.
